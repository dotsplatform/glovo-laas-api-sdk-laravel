 * To create an order, complete the details required accurately.
 * Remember that if you donâ€™t specify a scheduled pickup time,
 * the order you have created will be offered to a courier as soon as possible.
 *
 * Please note that orders can only be created on the days and at the times when the platform is active in each city.
 * These times are described in the documentation below for your reference.
 *
 * This endpoint geolocates a point based on the address provided in the rawAddress field.
 * The coordinates field is optional and can be used to provide more accurate geolocation information.
 * However, if coordinates are provided, they will take precedence over rawAddress in determining the location of the point.
 *
 * It is important to note that rawAddress is always mandatory,
 * as it serves as a label (along with details) for couriers to find the address at the location.
 * If coordinates are provided and are incorrect, the API call will fail.
 * Additionally, if coordinates are provided, rawAddress will not be used as a fallback.
